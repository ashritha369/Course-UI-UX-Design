## WHAT IS UX?

--> **UX GOALS**

- UX includes everything related to all the interactions that a user has with a company, its services and products.

  **Usability** : Usability gauges how intuitive or easier product is to use. Jacob Nielsen's, a highly recognized professional in the field of usability, proposes that you can evaluate usability through five usability components. They are learnability, efficiency, memorability, errors, and satisfaction.

--> 5 USABILITY COMPONENTS BY JAKOB NIELEN

- Learnability
- Efficiency
- Memorability
- Errors
- Satisfaction

1. Learnability
   Let's start with learnability. When his customers are trying to order for delivery, Adrian wants the process to be easy to learn from the first time they do it.
2. Efficiency
   The second component is efficiency. What if users want to change their order? Is it easy to do, and can they do it quickly and efficiently?
3. Memorability
   Third, comes memorability. What if a user gets distracted? Is it easy to remember where they were when they return? How quickly can they find where they were?
4. Errors
   Next, go to usability needs to consider errors. What if a user makes a mistake? The design should provide solutions to these mistakes and address them before they happen.
5. Satisfaction
   Finally, comes satisfaction. Is the website pleasant or satisfying to use? Do users enjoy using it? Is it easy to use? Measuring user satisfaction is not an easy task. However, you know how it feels when you use an intuitive and well-designed product. It helps to think about the usability, quality components at all stages of your design. If you consider them from the outset, you will solve problems earlier in the process.

1. Artifacts : Artifacts are documents that design teams create to gather, organize and present information throughout the UX process. You will have an introduction to below things:
   a. user personas,
   b. scenarios,
   c. user stories
   d. storyboards.

You will also cover UX / UI designers' processes to create them.

**A. USER PERSONAS:**
--> A user persona is a model or character that portrays a possible user of your website or app. Personas aid the design team in focusing on the end users while designing a product. Personas have been used in marketing since the middle of the 1990s. They are essential to the software development process's user experience research stage. Personas help a product team constantly focus on their target users, ensuring that the designed product fits their needs and requirements.
--> Multiple user types can engage with a website or app. Developing user personas helps determine the range of users, their age group, sociometric position etc. User research is the first step in creating a user persona. UX designers can understand users' behavior and motivations by observing them and designing accordingly. A few user research methods are conducting customer interviews, making assumptions, and using web analytics, all of which are described in the next section.

**B. Conducting customer interviews**
Interview at least five people. After conducting several interviews, you'll notice that you're getting very little or no new information. That means you don't need to interview any more users. Also, make use of whatever information you already have. You may have some thoughts on your customers. Whether you have previously conducted research or you know something for sure.

**C.Making assumptions**
If you've been working on a product for quite some time. You may have enough information to make reasonably accurate assumptions about your customers. Just make sure to back them up later with research.

**D.Using web analytics**
Web analytics tools are an excellent resource for quantitative data, so make the best of them. They can tell you how your customers behave but not why. You'll still need to talk to them to find out what motivates them.

**E.User stories**
A user story is a brief statement or abstract that describes the user and their need or goal. It establishes who the user is, what they require, and why they require it. Each user persona typically has one user story. User stories usually adhere to a straightforward template

In this example, the user story is:

"As an online banking customer, I want to add a payee to my account, so I can transfer money to the payee."

**F.Scenarios**
For example, a scenario could describe how the user transfers money to a payee using a mobile device on his way to work. Scenarios help stakeholders visualize the design team's ideas by providing context for the intended user experience — frequently bridging communication gaps between creative and business thinking. Scenarios aid the design team in imagining the ideal solution to a user's problem.

**G.Storyboards**
A storyboard is a visual representation of how a user will interact with a product. Designers can create different storyboards: sketches, illustrations and screenshots, slideshows and animations, or live demos.

Visualizing a design idea with an interactive storyboard, like high-fidelity prototypes closely resembling the final product, will help the audience remember, empathize, and connect with it.

**How to create a storyboard**
To create a storyboard, set the scene by defining:

your persona,

the environment (where the persona is) and

the plot (what they want to achieve).

Then you begin to sketch out the basic idea for each scene and build it up with as many interactions as you want.

--> **Overview of the UX process**

- The five UX process are:

1. Empathize
2. Define
3. Ideate
4. Prototype
5. Test and Build

A. EMPATHIZE:

- Interview the customers-> order meal-> listen to frustration
- The key here is to understand the user needs,and create the personas accordingly, so that we can refer it back.
- Create an empathy map, or a scenario map -> this will help us to avoid assumptions

B. DEFINE

- You will know who the users are
- What are their frustrations
- And the solutions to that
- Basically you will have the user need statement

C. IDEATE

- This can be done by brainstorming, pen and paper, thinking and ideating
- The key here is to not be specific for one idea and be open to iterate the process
- Iterate means is to reflect on your work and to refine it to get the best of it.
- Once sketched, develop it into wireframes.. A wire frame is a two dimensional representation of the user interface which is concerned with the placement and hierarchy of content the functionalities that are offered. And the expected actions that users will take

D. PROTOTYPE

- Simulation of the final product.
- Take the wireframes, give it some buttons, interactivity and then simulate a real scenario to acheive required goals.

E. TEST

- testing by yourselves and with customers interaction after trying a task.

F. BUILD
